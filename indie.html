            I love indie. Indie is a very broad genre, and while I do enjoy many
             of its different subgenres, my favorite is probably indie rock.

            <a class="band-link" href="#dcfc">Death Cab For Cutie</a>

        <h2 id="dcfc">Death Cab for Cutie</h2>
        <p class="band-intro">
            My favorite indie band is Death Cab for Cutie. I've been
             a fan of theirs for as long as I can remember, and I was fortunate
             enough to be able to see them live in concert recently. The lead singer,
             Ben Gibbard, is also the band's songwriter, and the lyricism
             seen in many of Death Cab's songs draws greatly from his experiences. As
             such, the band's music feels very genuine and almost intimate.
             <br><br>Fun fact: it is actually impossible for me to choose a favorite album
             from their discography; there's something I love about each one. Click on

                    Transatlanticism (2003)<br><br>This is their first big success. Drawing on themes
                     of long distance and separation, this album has also become a fan-favorite.
                     The most well-known song on this album is probably the title track, for its
                     long, repeated bridge.

                    Plans(2005)<br><br>Their fifth album is the most iconic. Featuring songs
                     like "I Will Follow You Into The Dark" and "What Sarah Said", Plans is
                     centered around the theme of loss.

                    Narrow Stairs (2008)<br><br>This album is interesting because the songs all continue
                     into each other, allowing for a very seamless listen of the entire album.
                     This is one of the most existential albums Death Cab has released.

                     creating a very different sound from their previous albums. Codes & Keys
                     is also the band's happiest album, as its songs are based largely off of
                     Gibbard's marriage to actress Zooey Deshanel.

                     the aftermath of a relationship and the resulting personal growth. The cover

                    Thank You For Today (2018)<br><br>This is Death Cab's most mainstream pop record to date.
                     The band drifts away from its traditional sound again. This album has themes
                     of growing older, but in my opinion it isn't well-executed.

                    Asphalt Meadows (2022)<br><br>This is their tenth album.
                     The focus here is that the
                     world changes as we grow older, even if we stay the same. The band
                     modernizes their iconic sound but stays true to their roots, and
                     pays homage to the people who helped them succeed.
