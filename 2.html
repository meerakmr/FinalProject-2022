            I love indie. My favorite indie band is Death Cab for Cutie. I've been
             a fan of theirs for as long as I can remember, and I was fortunate
             enough to be able to see them live in concert recently. The lead singer,
             Ben Gibbard, is also the band's songwriter, and the lyricism
             seen in many of Death Cab's songs draws greatly from his experiences. As
             such, the band's music feels very genuine and almost intimate.
             <br><br>Fun fact: it is actually impossible for me to choose a favorite album
             from their discography; there's something I love about each one. Click on
             an album cover to learn more.

                    Something About Airplanes.<br>This is Death Cab's first album.
                     It has a very raw, recorded-in-the-basement sound.

                    We Have The Facts And We're Voting Yes<br>This is Death Cab's second album.
                     It really just sounds like a continuation of Airplanes.</p>

                <p class="desc">
                    The Photo Album<br>Their third album is when they start to really get
                     their sound. This album's biggest song is "A Movie Script Ending".

                <p class="desc">
                    Transatlanticism<br>This is their first big success. Drawing on themes
                     of long distance and separation, this album has also become a fan-favorite.
                     The most well-known song on this album is probably the title track, for its
                     long, repeated bridge.

                <p class="desc">
                    Plans<br>Their fifth album is the most iconic. Featuring songs
                     like "I Will Follow You Into The Dark" and "What Sarah Said", Plans is
                     centered around the theme of loss.

                <p class="desc">
                    Narrow Stairs<br>This album is interesting because the songs all continue
                     into each other, allowing for a very seamless listen of the entire album.
                     This is one of the most existential albums Death Cab has released, and it
                     features an 8-minute song titled "I Will Possess Your Heart". It's probably
                     my least favorite song of theirs.

                <p class="desc">
                    Codes & Keys<br>In this album, Death Cab experiments with synths, creating
                     a very different sound from their previous albums. I personally love this,
                     although many fans do not. Codes & Keys is also the band's happiest album,
                     as its songs are based largely off of Gibbard's (short-lived) marriage to
                     actress Zooey Deshanel.

                    Kintsugi<br>Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with
                     gold. Based off of Gibbard's divorce from Deshanel, this album is about
                     the aftermath of a relationship and the resulting growth that
                     occurs. The album cover is an old photograph that was shredded and
                     warped.

                <p class="desc">
                    Thank You For Today<br>This is Death Cab's most mainstream pop record to date.
                     The band drifts away from its traditional sound again (see: Codes & Keys).
                     This album has themes of growing older, but in my opinion these themes aren't
                     well-executed.

                <p class="desc">
                    Asphalt Meadows<br>This is their tenth and most recent studio album, the tour
                     for which I got to attend. The theme here is the way in which the
                     world changes as we grow older, even if we stay the same. They
                     modernize their iconic sound in a way that stays true to their roots, and
                     pay homage to the people who helped them get to where they are now.
