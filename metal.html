            I love metal. Under the heavy metal umbrella, the bands I most enjoy
             are part of the subgenre called metalcore, which (in my experience)
             involves more clean vocals and cool guitar riffs/breakdowns.

        <p class="band-intro">
            Motionless in White is a classic metalcore band. Over the course of their
             discography, they've experimented quite a bit in order to refine their
             sound. Click on an album cover to learn more about it.

                    Creatures (2010)<br><br>Their first album is the fan-favorite. Motionless has even
                     released merch shirts with the text "Motionless In White Hasn't Been Good
                     Since Creatures" on the front.

                    Infamous (2012)<br><br>Their second album is widely regarded as their worst.
                     For this album, they went out of the standard metal mold, but
                     they weren't met with much positivity. It did, however, inspire
                     them to keep experimenting.

                    Reincarnate (2014)<br><br>This album is my favorite. Here, Motionless incorporated
                     many facets of industrial metal (eg. synths, repeated riffs) and various
                     aspects of gothic metal (which is exactly what it sounds like).

                    Graveyard Shift (2017)<br><br>Their fourth album sees the band exploring
                     the sounds they cultivated in Reincarnate. They pay homage
                     to their hometown in "570" and the album revolves around
                     themes of how hard work and dedication are necessary for success.

                    Disguise (2019)<br><br>This is the album that introduced me to the band,
                     so it is one of my favorites. The brighter colors in the cover
                     are indicative of the high energy levels seen in the songs on this
                     album. They also dig deeper into their heavy metal sound here.

                    Scoring the End of the World (2022)<br><br>This album takes a very dramatic
                     turn, as the theme is centered around the issues humans have
                     caused to the planet (eg. global warming) as well as each other
                     (eg. greed in capitalism). The fan-favorite off of this album is
                     "Slaughterhouse".

        <h2 id="ink">Ice Nine Kills</h2>
        <p class="band-intro">
            Ice Nine Kills describes themselves as a "theatricore" band, and I completely
             agree. Their early work was a little too scene for me, but when "The Silver Scream"
             came out, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
             Their focus over time has shifted towards horror in pop culture. Click on an album
             cover to learn more about it.

                    Every Trick in the Book (2015)<br><br>This album marks the beginning of INK's
                     pop culture horror era. The album is filled with horror book
                     references, calling on books like "Dracula", "Animal Farm", and
                     "Carrie".

                    The Silver Scream (2018)<br><br>This album was what made INK special. It was
                     the first to achieve mass popularity in the metal community, and the
                     first I had heard of them. Songs here reference horror movies like
                     "IT", "Jaws", "Saw", and "Friday the 13th" (my favorite).

                     builds off of the momentum gained from The Silver Scream. They
                     continue basing songs off of movies, this time referencing "Hostel", 
                     "Psycho", and "Child's Play", among others.
